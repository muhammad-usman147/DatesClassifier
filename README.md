# DatesClassifier
This model is about to identify different types of dates
## Overview
The project is about to classify different types of dates. The project will be going to be a mobile application, it will be used to capture and identify the type of dates with the click of a camera or from the image gallery. The application will then provide some information about the date that it has classified from the given input.
Goals
## Gather Dataset
1. To build a machine learning or deep learning classifier using for the dates to be identified
2.Build the mobile application to classify the image
3. To integrate the ML/DL model with the mobile application using the API request. If adding the classifier( model ) to cloud/ 
## Tools being used
#### 1.Python
Python will be used to develop the model using the KERAS(TensorFlow BackEnd) and matplotlib and NumPy for analysis if required. 
#### 2.React/ React Native
The design and development of the mobile application
#### 3.Deployment on the Cloud Service
