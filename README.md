# DatesClassifier
This model is about to identify different types of dates
## Overview
The project is about to classify different types of dates. The project will be going to be a mobile application, it will be used to capture and identify the type of dates with the click of a camera or from the image gallery. The application will then provide some information about the date that it has classified from the given input.
Goals
## Gather Dataset
1. To build a machine learning or deep learning classifier using for the dates to be identified
2.Build the mobile application to classify the image
3. To integrate the ML/DL model with the mobile application using the API request. If adding the classifier( model ) to cloud/ 
## Tools being used
#### 1.Python
Python will be used to develop the model using the KERAS(TensorFlow BackEnd) and matplotlib and NumPy for analysis if required. 
#### 2.React/ React Native
The design and development of the mobile application
#### 3.Deployment on the Cloud Service
## Specifications
As the project is been divided into two phases. 
Phase 1 consists of two parts 
As there is no dataset available as per our requirement so the dataset has to be collected manually. Which includes processes such as web scraping, collecting chunks from different places and in the end. Merging all of the data being gathered. The dataset consists of 17 types of different dates to be classified which are as follow
Ajwah
Medjool Dates 
Deglet Noor dates
Piarom dates
Mazafati dates
Barhi Dates
Rabbi dates
Thoory Dates
Sayer Dates
Dayri dates
Halawy Dates
Sukkary Dates
Safawi Dates
Saghai dates
Kholas dates
Zahidi dates
Khudri dates
Training and evaluating the model on the dataset, that has been accumulated. 
Phase 2
Phase two also consists belongs to the development of the mobile application â€¦..
